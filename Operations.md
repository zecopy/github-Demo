<h1>Basic operations of GIT :</h1>
<br>

1) CLONE : This creates a directory and downloads the remote repository existing on the github.(Copy of the repository actually)

2) INIT : This creates an empty git local directory, initialized with the git attributes.

3) PULL : This updates the change from the remote towards the local.

4) PUSH : This will update the changes of the local towards the remote.



<h1>Concepts of Branches :</h1>
Git works on the default branch called Main/Master. Several branches can be created on a single repository that will help to segregate the work of the project.
In order to update the content of one branch into another 'merge' operation  is performed.(i.e., copying the work of one branch into another)
In the local whatever changes we are doing are finally saved by using 'add' and 'commit'.(i.e., create,edit,delete all of them have to be saved with the help of 'commit' operation.)

NOTE: Repositories can either be PUBLIC or PRIVATE.
