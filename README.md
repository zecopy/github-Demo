<h3>Personal Note</h3><br>
Getting started with Git and GitHub felt overwhelming at first. There were so many unfamiliar tabs, buttons, branches, and strange terms like "commits," "pull requests," and "merge conflicts" — it honestly felt like learning a whole new language. And when you're already juggling with Java, C++, frontend and backend development, frameworks, tools, and everything else in computer science, it can feel like too much. Uploading code to GitHub seemed like a small step, but it took a lot of effort to get here. Only someone going through this journey can truly understand how much work goes on behind the scenes — it’s a lot more than just writing code.<br>

In my first git repo i'll try to mention some basic commands that i have learned so far. I'll also mention some definitions which I have picked up from ChatGPT.
