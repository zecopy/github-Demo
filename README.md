<h3>Personal Note</h3><br>
Getting started with Git and GitHub felt overwhelming at first. There were so many unfamiliar tabs, buttons, branches, and strange terms like "commits," "pull requests," and "merge conflicts" — it honestly felt like learning a whole new language. And when you're already juggling with Java, C++, frontend and backend development, frameworks, tools, and everything else in computer science, it can feel like too much. Uploading code to GitHub seemed like a small step, but it took a lot of effort to get here. Only someone going through this journey can truly understand how much work goes on behind the scenes — it’s a lot more than just writing code.<br>
<br>

In my first git repo i'll try to mention some basic commands that i have learned so far. I'll also mention some definitions which I have picked up from ChatGPT and elsewhere.<br>


<h4> Let's begin...<h4>

<h5>Version Control System :<h5> A VCS or Version Control System is a tool that helps you track changes to files or projects over time.<br>

It tracks the activities done on your project or in other words it keeps a history of changes made to your project.<br>

Allows you to revert to previous versions if needed.<br>

Makes it easy to collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work.<br>

Shows who changed what and when.<br>
<br>
The platform on which you are viewing this text now is a popular VCS(Version Control System) known as Github!<br>
Github is a storehouse of repositories. It is a remote server that stores repositories which are configured on every local machine to track the revision history of the projects. NOTE THAT GITHUB IS A CLOUD BASED SERVICE. we must create an account on github first.<br>

<h5> Git Bash :<h5> Git Bash is a command-line interface (CLI) for Windows that lets you use Git commands in a Unix-style environment. It is executed on local as a software.<br>

<h5> Markdown(md) :<h5>Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text using plain text syntax. It’s designed to be easy to read and write.<br>

<h5>README.md :<h5>README.md is a read-me file written in Markdown. It usually contains:

Project description

How to install/run the code

Author/contact info

License info

When you push a repo to GitHub, GitHub automatically renders the Markdown so it looks nicely formatted.
